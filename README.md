Software Design Project
_Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.

_What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_
I feel that idenfiying potential barriers that exist when creating a version of this application that can run across multiple platforms was the part of this assignment I was most pleased with. 

_What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_
Helped to create a map of what steps needed to be completed. This ensured all of the client's needs and requests were met. 

_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_
I would work on the development tools section. I would look into additional resources that can be used to make the development process more efficient. 

_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_
Learning about the game Draw it or Lose it helped to understand what experience the user was hoping for. 
Having the user's experience in mind during development can help to avoid potential disconnect in the user's expectations. 

_How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_
Reading the goals of The Gaming Room to learn what specific features they wanted in this program helped to develop effective gameplan. User interviews and surveys can help better meet user expectations. Usability testing can also ensure that code works the way it is supposed to. This process can also help to address potential bugs.
